# Gloved-vs-Ungloved-Hand-Detection

This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing medical gloves or not using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The goal is to build an AI-powered system that can automatically identify gloved vs. ungloved hands in real-world scenarios, such as healthcare environments, factories, and safety monitoring systems.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Trained YOLOv5 on a custom dataset (Hands & Medical Gloves images).

Supports real-time detection on images, videos, and webcam streams.

Can be integrated into safety compliance monitoring systems.

Includes dataset preprocessing, training pipeline, and inference scripts.
